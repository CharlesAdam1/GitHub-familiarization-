    <h1>Git and Github</h1>

    <p>
        This page explains how to create and manage your github repositories and track changes using git.
        Git is very user friendly and probably the best way to manage your remote repositories. Here you are supposed to
        create a github repositories and then make a branch from it. We will mainly focus on Branching by doing the following,

        <ol>
            <li>Create a second Branch</li>
            <li>Make changes on the second branch</li>
            <li>Commit and push both branches</li>
        </ol>
